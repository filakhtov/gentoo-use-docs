# app-arch/bzip2

### split-usr
If the flag is enabled some of the produced libraries will be installed into the `/lib` directory, instead of the `/usr/lib` directory, so that they are available during the early boot when the `/usr` partition is not yet mounted.

This flag is necessary to boot the system that has separated `/usr` partition, but otherwise can be safely disabled.

### static
Pass the `-static` option to the `make` command. Build and install statically linked binaries, e.g. a `bzip2`, a `bunzip2`, a `bzcat`, etc.

This flag should normally be disabled unless there is a need for static binaries.

### static-libs
Build and install a statically linked version of the `libbz2.a` library.

This flag should be disabled unless there is a need for static library.

### verify-sig
Perform signature verification of the upstream source code archive before extracting it and building the package.

It is safe to disable this flag.
