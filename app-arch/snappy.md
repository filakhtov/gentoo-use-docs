### test
Pass the `-DSNAPPY_BUILD_TESTS=true` option to the CMake command to build the `snappy_unittest` command and execute it when the main build is completed to run the test suite provided with the source code and check for regressions. This will extend a build time.

This flag should normally be enabled as these tests are mainly useful for the Gentoo team, testers or developers.
