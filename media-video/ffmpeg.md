It is safe to disable the flag, unless there is a need for the `drawtext` filter.

### twolame
Requires the `encode` flag to be enabled. Pass the `--enable-libtwolame` option to the configure script. Use the `libtwolame` library to provide an ability to encode audio in the MP2 (aka MPEG-1 Audio Layer II or MPEG-2 Audio Layer II) lossy compression format defined by the ISO/IEC 11172-3 standard.

The flag can be safely disabled, unless there is a specific need to encode audio in the MP2 format.

### v4l
When disabled, pass the `--disable-indev=v4l2` and `--disable-outdev=v4l2` options to the configure script. Enable support for the Video4Linux2 input and output video devices, that can be accessed via the `v4l2` option (or `video4linux2` alias). The input device is used to grab a video input from a the video device, such as a USB webcamera. The output device is used to produce a video stream in the Video 4 Linux format and can help to emulate capturing devices, e.g. via the `v4l2loopback` kernel module.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to capture video from Video 4 Linux devices or create a stream compatible with this format.

### vaapi
Pass the `--enable-vaapi` option to the configure script. Use the `libVA` library to enable support for the VA-API (Video Acceleration API). The API provides an ability to use a GPU to accelerate video encoding and decoding to offload processing from the CPU. VA-API is supported by Intel GPUs (via QuickSync), ATI/AMD GPUs (via UVD/VCE) and NVIDIA GPUs (with Nouveau driver only). Depending on hardware, it supports a wide range of different formats, including H.264, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, VC-1, H.265 and others.

It is highly recommended to enable this flag to accelerate video processing on supported platforms.

### vdpau
Pass the `--enable-vdpau` option to the configure script. Use the `libvdpau` library to enable support for VDPAU (​Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix), that is used for accelerated decoding, post-processing, compositing, and displaying compressed or uncompressed video streams on NVIDIA and ATI/AMD GPUs. Note: VDPAU is not suitable for encoding, is not updated since 2015, requires special code in the application to use it, and has support for only a limited number of the formats: H.264, MPEG-1/2/4, and VC-1.

This flag should be enabled on systems with old NVIDIA GPUs, and for newer cards `cuda` should be used instead.

### vidstab
Pass the `--enable-libvidstab` option to the configure script. Use the `vid.stab` library to enable support for the `vidstabdetect` video filter to analyze shaky and unstable videos and apply compensatory transformations using the `vidstabtransform` video stabilization filter.

It is safe to disable this flag if there is no need to perform video stabilization.

### vorbis
Pass the `--enable-libvorbis` option to the configure script. Use the external `libvorbis` library for encoding and decoding audio in the Vorbis format, instead of built-in experimental implementation. This will produce much higher quality when encoding.

It is recommended to enable this flag if there is a need to encode or decode the Vorbis audio format.

### vpx
Pass the `--enable-libvpx` option to the configure script. Use the `libvpx` library to enable support for decoding and encoding VP8 and VP9 video compression formats. Provides two video codecs - `libvpx` and `libvpx-v9` for VP8 and VP9 formats respectively.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to create WebM media format.

### vulkan
Pass the `--enable-vulkan` option to the configure script. Enable support for Vulkan API to offload video processing to the GPU and also enable support for AMD AMF (Advanced Media Framework)/VCE (Video Coding Engine) encoder.

This flag should be enabled on systems that have compatible AMD GPU to enable hardware-accelerated decoding.

### webp
Requires the `encode` flag to be enabled. Pass the `--enable-libwebp` option to the configure script. Use the `libwebp` library to provide an ability to encode images in WebP format, create animated WebP sequences, including converting any supported video format into a WebP animation and extracting video frames in the WebP format.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to create WebP images or animations.

### X
Pass the `--enable-xlib`, `--enable-libxcb`, `--enable-libxcb-shm` and `--enable-libxcb-xfixes` options to the configure script. Provide support for video playback and capturing within X11 server. Enable the X11 video input device (aka `x11grab`) that uses the `libX11`, `libXext` and `libXfixes` libraries to allow to capture a region of an X11 display. Enable the XVideo output device (`xv` runtime option) that uses the `libXv` library to allow to play a video stream in an X Server window.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### x264
Requires the `gpl` flag to be enabled due to the licensing restrictions and only works if the `encode` flag is enabled. Pass the `--enable-libx264` option to the configure script. Use the `libx264` library to provide an ability to encode videos in the H.264 (aka MPEG-4 Part 10 or MPEG-4 AVC) format.

This flag should be enabled to support H.264 encoding, however it is recommended to use its successor, the H.265 codec (see the `x265` flag) instead if the target media permits.

### x265
Only works when the `encode` flag is enabled and requires the `gpl` flag to be enabled due to the licensing restrictions. Pass the `--enable-libx265` option to the configure script. Use the `libx265` library to provide an ability to perform video encoding in the HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding, aka H.265 or MPEG-H Part 2) format.

It is recommended to enable this flag to perform high-quality video encoding, however not all the devices, especially older ones, are able to play it yet, let alone hardware acceleration.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to perform screen recording.

### xvid
Requires the `gpl` flag to be enabled due to the licensing restrictions and only works if the `encode` flag is enabled. Pass the `--enable-libxvid` option to the configure script. Use the `libxvid` library to provide an ability to encode video in the Xvid (aka DivX, MPEG-4 or MPEG-4 Part 2) format, that was widely used befor adoption of H.264.

This flag should normally be disabled, unless there is a specific need to perform MPEG-4 encoding, and modern alternatives, such as H.264 (`x264` flag), HEVC (`x265` flag), or VP8/VP9 (`vpx` flag) should be used instead.

### zeromq
Pass the `--enable-libzmq` option to the configure script. Provide an ability to receive commands sent through a `libzmq` client, and forward them to active filters. This allows to change filter options on-the-fly while FFmpeg is running and even do so over the network. Provides two pass-through filters: `zmq` for video formats and `azmq` for audio.

This flag should normally be disabled.

### zimg
Pass the `--enable-libzimg` option to the configure script. Enable the `zscale` video filter that allows to scale (resize) the input video, using the `libzimg` library. If the input image format is different from the format requested by the next filter, the zscale filter will convert the input to the requested format.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to perform video scaling with the `zscale` filter.

### zlib
Pass the `--enable-zlib` option to the configure script. This flag is required by the `cws2fws` tool. Enable support for the DEFLATE compression on various stream formats, such as Matroska.

It is recommended to enable this flag, unless there is absolutely no need to access Zlib compressed media.

### zvbi
Pass the `--enable-zvbi` option to the configure script. Use the `libzvbi` library to provide an ability to decode DVB teletext pages and DVB teletext subtitles.

It is safe to disable the flag, unless there is a need to support DVB teletext.
