If enabled together with the `luajit` flag, then disable the PaX MPROTECT restrictions from the resulting binary to prevent issues with Just-in-Time code generation. When disabled, pass the `--disable-cplayer` option to the waf build script to disable the command-line interface.

### dvd
Pass the `--enable-dvdnav` and `--enable-dvdread` option to the waf build script. Provide an ability to play DVD video discs and disc images using either the `libdvdnav` or `libdvdread`.

When enabled together with the `X` flag, then also pass the `--enable-egl-x11` option to the waf build script to allow to use the X Window System implementation of the EGL API. It can be useful on an embedded system that has only OpenGL ES capabilities and runs an X server. See the `X` flag for additional details.

If enabled together with the `gbm` flag, pass the `--enable-egl-drm` option to the waf build script to provide an ability to use the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) implementation for the EGL API via the Mesa GBM. This allows to use the OpenGL output without a full-featured window system. See the `gbm` flag for more details.
