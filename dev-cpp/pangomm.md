### gtk-doc
Pass the `-Dbuild-documentation=true` option to the meson build script. Generate an API documentation in the HTML format using the Doxygen tool that describes all library components, provides class relationship diagrams, etc, and install it into the `/usr/share/doc/pangomm-<VERSION>` directory.

It is safe to disable the flag.
