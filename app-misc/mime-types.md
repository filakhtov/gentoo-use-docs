# app-misc/mime-types

### nginx
Install the `mime.types.nginx` file into the `/etc/nginx` directory, so it can be used by the Nginx web server. This file contains a much broader and accurate mime type list in contrast to one shipped with Nginx by default.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to use the Nginx web server.
