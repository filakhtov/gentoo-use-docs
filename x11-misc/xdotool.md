# x11-misc/xdotool

### doc
Use the `Doxygen` tool to generate the API documentation for the `libxdo` library from the source code and install it into the system.

This flag should normally be disabled, unless development documentation is required.

### examples
Install additional example scripts describing how to use the `xdotool` for various use cases, such as activating the Firefox window and pasting the clipboard content into the URL bar, slide and activate a window when a mouse moves to a particular position, etc.

It is safe to disable this flag.
