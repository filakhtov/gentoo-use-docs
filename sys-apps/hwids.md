# sys-apps/hwids

### net
Pass the `NET=yes` (`no` when disabled) option to the `make` command. Install an `oui.txt` (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and an `iab.txt` (Individual Address Block) files. These files contain MAC address to vendor mappings.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### pci
Pass the `PCI=yes` (`no` if disabled) option to the `make` command. Install a `pci.ids` file containing IDs for PCI devices, their names and vendors. This file can be used by `lspci` for device identification.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to use an `lspci` command from a [sys-apps/pciutils](pciutils.md) package. It can be safely disabled otherwise.

### systemd
Execute the `systemd-hwdb update` command after the main build is completed. Update binary hardware database based on the identification files installed by this package.

It is recommended to enable this flag on systemd based systems, and should be disabled otherwise.

### udev
Pass the `UDEV=yes` (`no` when disabled) option to the `make` command. Execute a `udevadm hwdb --update` command after the main build is complete. Install Udev hardware database files and generates `hwdb.bin`.

It is recommended to enable this flag. Udev database can be used by the Udev itself and also by an `lspci` command if `udev` flag is enabled for a [sys-apps/pciutils](pciutils.md) package.

### usb
Pass the `USB=yes` (`no` if disabled) option to the `make` command. Install a `usb.ids` file containing IDs for USB devices, their names and vendors. This file is used by `usbutils` to identify USB devices.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to use `usbutils`. It can be safely disabled otherwise.
