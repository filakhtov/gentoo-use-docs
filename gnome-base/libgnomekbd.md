# gnome-base/libgnomekbd

### introspection
Pass a `-Dintrospection=true` option to the Meson build script. Generate a `Gkbd-3.0.gir` GIR metadata file to provide dynamic bindings for a `libgnomekbd` and a `libgnomekbdui` libraries to languages other than C using the GObject Introspection.

It is safe to disable the flag.
