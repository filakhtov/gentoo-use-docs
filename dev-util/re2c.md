# dev-util/re2c

### debug
Pass the `--enable-debug` option to the configure script. Enable runtime checks and assertions, and print plenty of internal debugging output when running `re2c`.

This should normally be disabled, unless there is a need to debug the tool itself.

### test
This flag does nothing and should be disabled.
