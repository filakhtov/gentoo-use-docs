### emacs
Execute the `elisp-compile misc/desktop-entry-mode.el` command to compile and install an Emacs major mode for `.desktop` files editing, which provides basic support with syntax highlighting and validation.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to edit `.desktop` files using an Emacs editor.
