# gnome-extra/cinnamon

### eds
Pull in the [gnome-extra/evolution-data-server](../gnome-extra/evolution-data-server.md) package as a dependency. Gentoo provides a patch that dynamically detects Evolution Data Server availability at runtime, and when available, the Cinnamon Calendar applet will display events from the Evolution personal information management.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### gstreamer
Pass the `-Dbuild_recorder=true` option to the `meson` build script. Build and install the `cinnamon-recorder` binary - a Cinnamon built-in screen recording utility.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### gtk-doc
Pass the `-Ddocs=true` option to the configure script. Use the Gtk-Doc tool to generate documentation in the HTLM format and install it into system.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### networkmanager
Pass a `-Ddisable_networkmanager=false` (`true` if this flag is disabled) option to the `meson` build script. Build and install a `network@cinnamon.org` Cinnamon applet that is based on a NetworkManager's nm-applet to provide network management UI.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### nls
Pull in a [gnome-extra/cinnamon-translations](../gnome-extra/cinnamon-translations.md) package as a dependency to provide translations for Cinnamon desktop environment.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to use Cinnamon in a non-English language.
