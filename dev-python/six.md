### doc
Use the Python Sphinx documentation generator to produce an HTML API documentation and install it into the `/usr/share/doc/six-<VERSION>/html` directory.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### test
Execute the `pytest` command when the main build is completed to run the test suite provided with the source code and check for any regressions. This will extend the build time.

This flag should normally be disabled, as it is mainly useful for the maintainers, testers and developers.
