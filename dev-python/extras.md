# dev-python/extras

### test
Execute the `tests/test_extras.py` script from the source directory for each active Python implementation after the main build is completed to run the test suite provided with the source code and check for any regressions.

This flag should normally be disabled, because these tests are primarily oriented towards developers, maintainers and testers.
