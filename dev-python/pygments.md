### test
Copy the tests directory from the source tree into the build directory. Run the `pytest` command after the main build is completed to run the test suite provided with the source code to check for regressions. This will extend the build time.

This flag should normally be disabled as it is mainly used by developers, testers, maintainers and not end users.
