### debug
Pass the `--enable-debug` option to the configure script. Print additional debugging messages at runtime and print extended diagnostic messages when assertions fail before aborting the program.

It is safe to disable this flag, however it can be useful when troubleshooting.

### opengl
Pass the `--enable-glx` option to the configure script. Enable support for accelerated rendering and scaling video output via OpenGL API using the GLX (OpenGL Extension to the X Window System).

It is recommended to enable this flag on supported systems.
