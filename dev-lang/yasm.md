# dev-lang/yasm

### nls
Pass the `--enable-nls` option to the configure script. Use the Gettext library to provide an ability to translate programs messages at runtime into various languages based on the system locale settings.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to use Yasm in a non-English language.
