# dev-lang/python-exec

### native-symlinks
Install a generic version symlinks (i.e. `python` and `python3`) pointing to the approprriate Python interpreter version, `python3.X`. With this flag disabled only `python3.X` executables will be installed and any scripts that point to `python` or `python3` won't work.

It is recommended to enable this flag.
