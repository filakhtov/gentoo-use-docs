### cairo
Pass the `-Dcairo=enabled` option to the meson build script. Build and install the `hb-view` tool to generate a graphical view of a string shape, using a particular font, as a set of glyphs.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### debug
By default, sanity checks that are intended for debugging and are safe and recommended to disable in production are built. When this flag is disabled, append `-DHB_NDEBUG` option to the `CPPFLAGS` variable for a duration of the build and therefore disable simple memory allocation and deallocation checks and related assertions.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to debug the library itself or any linked applications.

### doc
Pass the `-Ddocs=enabled` option to the meson build script. Use the Gtk-Doc tool to generate documentation in the HTML format and install it into the `/usr/share/gtk-doc/harfbuzz` directory. The documentation includes a user manual with library description, installation, usage steps, concepts description, library API developer reference and so forth.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### experimental
Pass the `-Dexperimental_api=true` option to the meson build script. Enable support for experimental API in various HarfBuzz libraries.

This flag should normally be disabled, because the API is unstable and unreliable for any production use.

### glib
Pass the `-Dglib=enabled` option to the meson build script. Use the `GLib` library for Unicode support, provide GObject introspection, build the `hb-view`, `hb-shape`, `hb-ot-shape-closure` and `hb-subset` tools and the `libharfbuzz-subset` and `libharfbuzz-gobject` libraries.

It is recommended to enable this flag as many packages (e.g. the Pango library) depend on provided features.

### graphite
Pass the `-Dgraphite=enabled` option to the meson build script script. Provide support for Graphite fonts - TrueType fonts with additional tables containing smart rendering information via the `libgraphite2` library.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to use Graphite fonts, e.g. for non-roman script languages.

### icu
Pass the `-Dicu=enabled` option to the meson build script. Build and install the `libharfbuzz-icu` library that provides a drop-in replacement for the ICU Layout Engine designed to handle logical order of glyphs in complex scripts.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### introspection
Pass the `-Dgobject=enabled` and the `-Dintrospection=enabled` options to the meson build script. Generate the `HarfBuzz-0.0.gir` GIR metadata file during build time and compile a typelib from it to provide dynamic HarfBuzz library bindings to languages other than C.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### test
Pass the `-Dtests=enabled` option to the meson build script. Prepare a Python environment to properly run the tests and execute the test suite provided with the source code during the build to check for any regressions. This will extend a build time.

It is recommended to disable the flag as it is mainly useful for the Gentoo team, testers and developers.

### truetype
Pass the `-Dfreetype=enabled` option to the configure script. Use the `freetype` library for loading fonts and glyph metrics instead of using `HarfBuzz`'s internal font functions.

This flag should be enabled to improve font shaping.
