### 10bit
Pass the `-DLINKED_10BIT=true` option to the CMake command. Enable support for encoding videos with 10-bit color depth profiles.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### 12bit
Pass the `-DLINKED_12BIT=true` option to the CMake command. Enable support for encoding videos with 12-bit color depth profiles.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### numa
Pass the `-DENABLE_LIBNUMA=ON` option to the CMake command. Enable support for NUMA topology, allowing to create one or more thread pools per encoder, one pool per CPU socket to avoid cross-socket memory access and harm performance.

This flag should only be enabled on systems with multiple CPU sockets.

### pic
By default, when this flag is disabled, libx265 is built with Assembly optimizations, however the Assembly code that is used is not PIC (Position Independent Code) safe, so when the flag is enabled, pass the `-DENABLE_ASSEMBLY=OFF` option to the CMake command to disable the aforementioned optimizations.

This flag can be enable to improve security at the expense of performance optimization.

### test
Pass the `-DENABLE_TESTS=ON` option to the Cmake command to build the test suite provided with the source code and execute the `cmake test` command when the main build is completed to run it and check for any regressions.

This flag should normally be disabled as it is primarily oriented towards the developers, maintainers and testers.
