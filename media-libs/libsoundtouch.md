# media-libs/libsoundtouch

### openmp
Pass the `--enable-openmp` option to the configure script. Use the OpenMP API to perform parallel multi-core calculations.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### static-libs
Pass the `--enable-static` option to the configure script. Build and install a statically linked version of the `libSoundTouch` library.

This flag should be disabled unless there is an explicit need for the static library.
