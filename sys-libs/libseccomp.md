# sys-libs/libseccomp

### experimental-loong
Apply an experimental patch to support 64-bit LoongArch compatible RISC microprocessors (starting from Loongson 3 5000 series).

This flag should only be enabled on systems running on compatible Loongson processors.

### python
Run the `setup.py` script from the `src/python` subdirectory to configure the Python bindings for `libseccomp` library, then run `make` to build and `make install` to install the `seccomp` Python module that provides an API for the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering capability, seccomp.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### static-libs
Pass the `--enable-static` option to the configure script. Build and install a statically linked version of the `libseccomp` library.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need for the static library.

### test
Execute the `make check` command after the main build is completed to run the test suite provided with the source code and check for any regressions. This will extend overall build time.

This flag should normally be disabled, because the test suite is tailored towards the developers, maintainers and testers.
