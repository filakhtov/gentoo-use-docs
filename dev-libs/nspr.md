# dev-libs/nspr

### debug
Pass the `--enable-debug` option to the configure script if enabled. Build an unoptimized debug verion of the libraries. Print a great deal of additional information at the runtime. Enable internal tracing. When this flag is disabled pass the `--disable-debug` and `--disable-optimize` options instead to enable the optimized build.

This flag should normally be disabled. It is useful for the development against NSPR library.
