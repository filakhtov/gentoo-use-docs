# dev-libs/libpcre2

### bzip2
Pass the `--enable-pcre2grep-libbz2` option to the configure script. Link the `pcre2grep` tool against the `libbz2` library to handle files compressed with BZip2 algorithm.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to search for patterns in BZip2 archives.

### jit
Pass the `--enable-jit` and the `--enable-pcre2grep-jit` options to the configure script. Enable Just-In-Time compiling support for both the `libpcre2` library and the `pcre2grep` tool for faster matching.

It is recommended to enable this flag if platform supports the JIT compilation.

### libedit
Pass the `--enable-pcre2test-libreadline` option to the configure script. Link the `pcre2test` binary against the `libedit` library to allow reading terminal input using the `libedit` library and provide line editing and history facilities.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### pcre16
Pass the `--enable-pcre2-16` option to the configure script. Build and install a library for 16-bit characters support. It is recommended to enable `unicode` flag together with this flag to support `UTF-16` encoding.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### pcre32
Pass the `--enable-pcre2-32` option to the configure script. Build and install a library for 32-bit characters support. It is recommended to enable `unicode` flag together with this flag to support `UTF-32` encoding.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### readline
Pass the `--enable-pcre2test-libreadline` option to the configure script. Link the `pcre2test` binary against the `libreadline` library to allow reading terminal input using the `libreadline` library and provide line editing and history facilities.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### recursion-limit
Pass the `--with-match-limit-depth=8192` option (instead of `MATCH_LIMIT`) to the configure script. Normally, recursive matching is done up until the maximum amount of stack (or heap) is used. Enabling this option will limit recursion to `8192` calls.

This option should normally be enabled to cut execution early and save resources unless there is a specific need to deal with a recursive pattern matching that can hit this limit.

### split-usr
If the flag is enabled some of the produced libraries will be installed into the `/lib` directory, instead of the `/usr/lib` directory, so that they are available during the early boot when the `/usr` partition is not yet mounted.

This flag is necessary to boot the system that has separated `/usr` partition, but otherwise can be safely disabled.

### static-libs
Pass the `--enable-static` option to the configure script.

### unicode
Pass the `--enable-unicode` option to the configure script. Enable support for Unicode and UTF encodings. As well as supporting UTF strings, Unicode support includes support for the `\P`, `\p`, and `\X` sequences that recognize Unicode character properties, but only the basic two-letter properties such as `Lu` are supported.

It is recommended to enable this flag as Unicode character set is everywhere nowadays.

### zlib
Pass the `--enable-pcre2grep-libz` option to the configure script. Link the `pcre2grep` tool against the `libz` library to handle files compressed with zlib algorithm.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to search for patterns in zlib compressed data.
