This flag should be enabled if there is a need to view DVI documents.

### gnome
Pass the `-Dthumbnail_cache=enabled` option to the meson build script. Use the `libgnome-desktop` library to cache generated previews of the document's first pages for fast access in the list of recently opened documents.

Generate and install the `EvinceDocument-3.0.gir` and `EvinceView-3.0.gir` GIR metadata files to provide dynamic bindings for the `libevdocument3` and `libevview3` libraries to languages other than C using the GObject Introspection framework.

The flag can be safely disabled.
