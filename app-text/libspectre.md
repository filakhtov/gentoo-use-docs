### debug
Pass the `--enable-asserts` and `--enable-checks` options to the configure script. Enable support for runtime assertions, perform additional runtime checks and print warning messages if they fail.

This flag should only be enabled for debug purposes and disabled on production systems.

### doc
Use the Doxygen tool to generate documentation in the HTML format and install it into the system. Documentation is developer oriented and provides overview of data structures and symbol definitions exported by the library.

This flag should normally be disabled.
