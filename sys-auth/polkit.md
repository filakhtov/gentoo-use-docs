# sys-auth/polkit

### elogind
Pass the `--enable-libelogind` option to the configure script. Use a `libelogind` library to track session via elogind instead of default ConsoleKit.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to use elogind as a session manager.

### examples
Install code examples into a `/usr/share/doc/polkit-<VERSION>/examples` directory. Examples include a C and a Python code.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### gtk
Pull in a [gnome-extra/polkit-gnome](../gnome-extra/polkit-gnome.md) or an [lxde-base/lxsession](../lxde-base/lxsession.md) package as a runtime dependency. These packages provide an authentication agent - a `polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1` or a `lxpolkit` respectively.

This flag should be enabled if target system to be running a GTK-based or an LXDE-based Desktop Environments.

### introspection
Pass the `--enable-introspection` option to the configure script. Generate GIR metadata `Polkit-1.0.gir` and `PolkitAgent-1.0.gir` files during the build time to provide dynamic bindings support for languages other than C.

It is safe to disable the flag unless there is an explicit need for GIR files.

### jit
This flag does nothing.

### kde
Pull in a [kde-plasma/polkit-kde-agent](../kde-plasma/polkit-kde-agent.md) package as a runtime dependency that provides `polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1`.

This flag should be enabled if target system to be running a KDE-based Desktop Environment.

### nls
Pass the `--enable-nls` option to the configure script. Provide an ability to translate program messages to a system locale language.

It is safe to disable this flag if there is no need for non-English languages.

### pam
Pass the `--with-pam-module-dir`, and the `--with-authfw=pam` (instead of `shadow`) options to the configure script. Enable integration with a PAM stack while asking for elevated permissions via `pkexec`.

It is recommended to enabled this flag so that polkit honours PAM settings.

### selinux
Pull in a [sec-policy/selinux-policykit](../sec-policy/selinux-policykit.md) as a runtime dependency. Install SELinux policies for a polkit authorization manager.

This flag should ever be toggled system-wide, i.e. as part of a SELinux-enabled Portage profile.

### systemd
Pass the `--enable-libsystemd-login` option to the configure script. Enable integration with a SystemD logind (systemd-logind) daemon for session tracking, instead of a default ConsoleKit daemon.

This flag should generally be toggled system-wide, e.g. as part of SystemD Portage profile.

### test
Pass the `--enable-test` option to the configure script. Run a `make check` command during a build. Execute a test suite provided with a source code. This will extend a build time.

This flag should normally be disabled as it is only useful for the Gentoo team, developers and testers.
