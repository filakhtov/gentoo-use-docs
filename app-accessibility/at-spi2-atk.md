### test
Pass the `-Dtests=true` option to the meson build script. Start a new Xvfb session and execute the `meson test` command from the build directory inside of the D-Bus session when the main build is completed. Run the test suite provided with the source code to check for regressions. This will extend a build time.

This flag should normally be disabled. It is primarily intended for the Gentoo team, testers and developers.
