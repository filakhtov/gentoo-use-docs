### test
Execute the `make check` command after the main build is completed to run a test suite provided with the source code and check for any regressions. This will extend the build time.

This flag should normally be disabled, because these test are primarily oriented towards the maintainers, developers and testers, but can be enabled to check the correctness of the build on a given system.
